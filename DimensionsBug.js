This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, specifically when the app is running on a device with a very high refresh rate.  The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` might return incorrect or inconsistent dimensions immediately after the app starts, before the screen dimensions have fully settled. This can lead to layout issues or unexpected behavior.
